# Zoom-Meeting-Attender
---

This is a python bot made with pyautogui that will:
1) log into zoom
2) join the meeting on start time
3) leave the meeting on end time 
4) Do this for how many ever meetings you set for the day.

This python script reads csv files which takes in 4 parameters(meeting id, meeting password, start time and end time).

To run this python script you need to install the requirements. You can do that by simply:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
